# Frontend Mentor challenge - Four card feature section

<p>My version of Four card feature section for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/four-card-feature-section-weK1eFYK).</p>
<p>For this challenge I used plain HTML and SASS. Component is responsive!</p>
<p>Didn't take me long to finish this one, around 1.5h</p>
